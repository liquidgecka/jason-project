=============

A simple tic tac toe game that shows the decision tree as it thinks.

Running this program is fairly simple:

There are two versions of this program, one with a viewer, and one without.
The viewer is the window where the tree is created. Viewing the AI makes the
program a bit slower but still playable.

The noviewer program is just tic tac toe.
